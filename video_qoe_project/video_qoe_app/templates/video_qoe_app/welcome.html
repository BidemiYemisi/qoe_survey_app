                <p class="lead pt-2">Thanks for agreeing to take part in this survey. The aim of this survey is to measure your perception of the overall quality of the videos
                    that
                    will be
                    shown to you.
                    So pick a rating that accurately reflect how you felt about the sound and image quality of the
                    videos that will be shown to you.
                    The survey only takes about 10 mins to complete.</p>
